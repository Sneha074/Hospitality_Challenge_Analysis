# Hospitality_Challenge_Analysis

This project presents an in-depth analysis of hospitality industry data using Power BI.
The dashboard provides insights into key performance indicators, trends, and patterns, helping stakeholders make informed decisions. 
This project is a valuable tool for improving efficiency and profitability in the hospitality sector. Let's understand the porject using STAR technique:

# Situation (S):

AtliQ Grands, a luxury hotel chain in India, was losing market share and revenue due to:

* Competitive strategic moves from rival hotel chains.
* Ineffective management decisions caused by a lack of data-driven insights.
* No in-house analytics team to track business performance.

To regain market share and revenue, AtliQ Grands decided to implement Business & Data Intelligence using Power BI.

# Task (T):

As a data analyst, my responsibilities were:
* Import and transform raw data to ensure accuracy.
* Create a data model to structure relationships between different datasets.
* Develop 27 key business metrics using DAX (Data Analysis Expressions).
* Build an interactive Power BI dashboard with actionable insights.
* Identify additional insights beyond the initial requirements.

# Action (A):

1. Data Import & Transformation

* Tools Used: Power BI, Power Query
* Imported multiple datasets into Power BI and verified their integrity.
* Performed data cleaning & transformation, ensuring consistent formats.

2.  Data Modeling
* Tools Used: Power BI (Data Model View)
* Created relationships between different data tables to enable seamless analysis.
* Ensured an optimized data structure for efficient querying and reporting.

3. KPI & Metric Development (27 Key Measures)

* Technology Used: DAX (Data Analysis Expressions)
* Developed key performance indicators (KPIs) for revenue insights, including:
* RevPAR (Revenue per Available Room) – Measures revenue generation per room.
* Occupancy % – Tracks the percentage of occupied rooms.
* ADR (Average Daily Rate) – Determines the average room price paid by guests.
* Realization % – Measures actual revenue against potential revenue.
* Cancellation % – Tracks booking cancellations.
* Average Rating – Measures guest satisfaction across properties.
